# Mac Code Workflow Setup automated with Alexa


# Description
With Alexa, IFTTT, Dropbox, Keyboard Maestro, and Applescript, I am able to create a fun chain of API commands that sets  my computer up for my preferred coding environment.
This is inspired by the tutorial I saw at
https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/controlling-a-mac-from-afar-with-ifttt-and-dropbox--cms-27073
All work done for fun/learning, no credit :). 

## Tools: 
- Alexa
- IFTTT
- Dropbox
- Keyboard Maestro
- Applescript
- Winter Break

## Requirements/Installation
1. Setup Amazon Alexa product
2. Register IFTTT Acount
3. Setup and Locally Connect Dropbox Account
Add the rest. Too busy working on this thing. 

## Usage
Still need to write usage instructions

## Extensions:
- further extend iterm setup in applescript
- setup sublime text to open with all the requiesites we want
- enable choice of different workflow environments (alex open python environment, alexa open ruby environment, etc)
- figure out how to make ifttt applet public (https://ifttt.com/applets/47226218d-mac-code-setup)
